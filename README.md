# simRMsynth
A python notebook that simulates and plots Stokes Q,U(frequency) data, RM synthesis, and output Faraday spectra


Input frequency information can be provided at the first text "***INPUT***" (cell 2)
The default included currently are for some LOFAR HBA observations.
The code calculates the theoretical RMSF, parameters, and Faraday spectrum using RM Synthesis (Brentjens & De Bruyn 2005).
The user can also provide extra parameters for the Stokes Q,U(freq) data to simulate instrumental effects, at the second appearance of "***INPUT***" (cell 6).

Feedback on the code (suggestions, problems, questions) is welcome.
